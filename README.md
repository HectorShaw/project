<p>This repository showcases a collection of personal projects, aimed at demonstrating my skills in full stack web development. These projects were built using various technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and SQL.</p>

<p>Each project showcases my ability to develop a complete web application, from the front-end user interface to the back-end server and database. Whether it's a simple to-do list application or a complex e-commerce platform, these projects highlight my ability to build and deploy web applications that are both functional and visually appealing.</p>

<p>Please feel free to browse through the code and take a look at my approach to solving various web development problems. I welcome any feedback or suggestions for improvement.</p>
